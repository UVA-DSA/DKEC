    "008.45: Clostridioides difficile infection": "Treatments are used only for symptoms of infection. People who carry the bacteria but aren't sick don't get treated.\nAntibiotics\nIf C. difficile infection is related to an antibiotic, a health care provider will likely stop its use. Often, however, an antibiotic is needed to treat another infectious condition. A switch to another antibiotic might be less likely to cause diarrhea related to C. difficile infection.\nAntibiotics are the main treatment for C. difficile infection. Commonly used antibiotics include:\nVancomycin (Firvanq Kit).\nFidaxomicin (Dificid).\nMetronidazole (Flagyl) may be used with vancomycin to treat serious C. difficile infection.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the diseased part of the colon may be needed if there's: Severe pain. Organ failure. Toxic megacolon.Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the lining of the wall around the stomach area.\nTreatment for repeat infection\nAbout 25% of people treated for C. difficile infection get sick again. The reason might be that the first infection never went away or that bacteria cause a new infection. The risk increases with each C. difficile infection. After three or more infections, the risk of another infection is greater than 50%.\nRisk of repeat infection is higher for people who: Are older than 65. Are taking other antibiotics for another condition while on antibiotics for C. difficile infection. Have a severe medical condition, such as chronic kidney failure, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease.\nTreatment for C. difficile infection that comes back might include the following:\nAntibiotics. Treatment for repeat infections may involve one or more courses of an antibiotic. The antibiotic is often different from the one used at first. Antibiotic therapy works less well each time the infection comes back.\nAntibody-based therapy. A therapy known as bezlotoxumab (Zinplava) is a human antibody against C. difficile toxin B. It has been shown to cut the risk of repeat C. difficile infection in those at high risk of repeat episodes.\nFecal microbiota transplant (FMT). FMT is a newer treatment for C. difficile infection that keeps coming back. FMT has been studied in clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved FMT but allows the use of FMT for C. difficile infection as a test.\nProbiotics. Probiotics are supplements or foods that have microorganisms to keep or improve the good bacteria in the body. The role of these products in C. difficile infection is not clear. Not all the research has shown that probiotics are helpful in preventing or treating infection with C. difficile.Researchers are studying advanced probiotics for treatment or prevention of C. difficile infection. These products aren't offered outside of research studies.",

Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure.\nTreatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you might need treatment for end-stage kidney disease.\nTreating the cause\nYour doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure, has been controlled.\nTreating complications\nKidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments might include:\nHigh blood pressure medications.People with kidney disease can have worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor might recommend medications to lower your blood pressure \u2014 commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers \u2014 and to preserve kidney function.High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you might need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor may also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet.Medications to relieve swelling.People with chronic kidney disease often retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body.Medications to treat anemia.Supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron, help produce more red blood cells. This might relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia.Medications to lower cholesterol levels.Your doctor might recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often have high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease.Medications to protect your bones.Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You might also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification).A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood.As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor might recommend eating less protein.

However, it may be done in emergency situations. If it's scheduled, a blood thinner such as warfarin (Jantoven) may need to be taken for a few weeks before the procedure. The medicine reduces the risk of blood clots and strokes.\nAfter electrical cardioversion, medicines to control the heart rhythm may be needed for life to prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Sometimes ablation is the first treatment.\nAFib\nCardiac ablation often uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart. The scars disrupt irregular heart signals and restore a typical heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube called a catheter through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.\nLess commonly, ablation is done using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.\nThere are several types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation.Heat energy is usually applied to the heart tissue at theAVnode to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After this treatment, a pacemaker is needed for life.Maze procedure.A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern \u2014 or maze \u2013 of scar tissue in the upper chambers of the heart. Scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals. So the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.If a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferredAFibtreatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.Hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation.This therapy combines ablation with surgery. It is used to treat long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.Pulsed field ablation.This is a treatment for some types of continued atrial fibrillation. It does not use heat or cold energy. Instead, it uses high energy electric pulses to create areas of scar tissue in the heart.

If this happens, another ablation or heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.\nIf you haveAFibbut can't take blood thinners, you may need a procedure to seal a small sac in the left upper heart chamber. This sac, called an appendage, is where mostAFibrelated clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device stays in permanently. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage also is an option for some people withAFibwho are having another heart surgery.\nAFib\nAFib\nAFib\nMore InformationAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related information\nMore Information\nAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillationShow more related information\nAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo ClinicAblation therapyAtrial fibrillation ablationAV node ablationCardiac ablationMaze procedureMinimally invasive heart surgeryPulmonary vein isolationMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillation\nAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo Clinic\nAtrial fibrillation care at Mayo Clinic\nAblation therapy\nAblation therapy\nAtrial fibrillation ablation\nAtrial fibrillation ablation\nAV node ablation\nAV node ablation\nCardiac ablation\nCardiac ablation\nMaze procedure\nMaze procedure\nMinimally invasive heart surgery\nMinimally invasive heart surgery\nPulmonary vein isolation\nPulmonary vein isolation\nMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillation\nMayo Clinic Minute: Identifying and treating atrial fibrillation\nShow more related information\n",

It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nYou'll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment. Treatment with levothyroxine likely will be lifelong. Because the dosage you need may change, your health care provider may check yourTSHlevel every year.\nTSH\nFinding the right dosage\nTo find the right dosage of levothyroxine for you, your health care provider checks your level ofTSHabout 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine. You may need another blood test to checkTSHagain six months later. Too much levothyroxine can cause side effects, such as:\nTSH\nTSH\nTiredness.Increased appetite.Sleep problems.Shakiness.Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.\nTiredness.\nIncreased appetite.\nSleep problems.\nShakiness.\nPounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.\nLevothyroxine typically causes no side effects when used in the correct dose. If you change brands of the medicine, tell your health care provider, as the dosage may need to change.\nIf you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your health care provider may start treatment with a smaller amount of medicine and then slowly increase the dosage. This allows your heart to adjust to the rise in your body's metabolism.\nTaking levothyroxine correctly\nLevothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you take the hormone in the morning, and then wait 30 to 60 minutes before you eat or take other medicine. If you take the medicine at bedtime, wait to take it until at least four hours after your last meal or snack.\nDon't skip doses or stop taking the medicine because you feel better. If you do, it's likely that the symptoms of hypothyroidism will slowly return. If you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.\nSome medicines, supplements and even some foods may affect your body's ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your health care provider if you eat large amounts of soy products, or if you typically eat a high-fiber diet. Also, tell your provider if you take other medicines, especially:\nIron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.Calcium supplements.\nIron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.\nAluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.\nCalcium supplements.\nSubclinical hypothyroidism\nIf you are diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, talk about treatment with your health care provider.

Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include:\nAntibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic.\nCough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest.\nFever reducers/pain relievers. You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort.

    "311: Major depressive disorder": "Many types of antidepressants are available, including those below. Be sure to discuss possible major side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Doctors often start by prescribing an SSRI. These drugs are considered safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd).\nSerotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

These medications don't fit neatly into any of the other antidepressant categories. They include bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR, Aplenzin, Forfivo XL), mirtazapine (Remeron), nefazodone, trazodone and vortioxetine (Trintellix).\nTricyclic antidepressants. These drugs — such as imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil) — can be very effective, but tend to cause more-severe side effects than newer antidepressants. So tricyclics generally aren't prescribed unless you've tried an SSRI first without improvement.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs — such as tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil) and isocarboxazid (Marplan) — may be prescribed, typically when other drugs haven't worked, because they can have serious side effects. Using MAOIs requires a strict diet because of dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with foods — such as certain cheeses, pickles and wines — and some medications and herbal supplements. Selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do. These medications can't be combined with SSRIs.\nOther medications.

One medication, nimodipine (Nymalize) has been shown to decrease circulation problems to the brain after a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nA common complication after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is delayed spasm of the blood vessels in the brain. This can cause stroke if it reduces the blood flow below a certain level. When this complication occurs, strokes may be avoided by raising the blood pressure with intravenous medications or increasing the width of the blood vessels in the brain with medications.\nAnother common complication is hydrocephalus which is an accumulation of fluid in brain spaces. This problem can be treated with drains inserted in the head (ventriculostomy catheter) or in the lower back (lumbar drains).\nSometimes, procedures need to be repeated.

The drug may trick the parathyroid glands into releasing less parathyroid hormone. This drug is sold as cinacalcet (Sensipar).Cinacalcet may be an option to treat primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly if surgery hasn't successfully cured the disorder or a person isn't a good surgery candidate.Cinacalcet and vitamin D analogs (prescription forms of vitamin D) are used to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease. These medications help keep the balance of calcium and phosphorus minerals so that the parathyroid glands don't have to work hard.The most commonly reported side effects of cinacalcet are joint and muscle pain, diarrhea, nausea, and respiratory infection.Hormone replacement therapy.For women who have gone through menopause and have signs of osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy may help bones keep calcium. However, this treatment doesn't address the underlying problems with the parathyroid glands.Prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of blood clots and breast cancer. Work with your health care provider to evaluate the risks and benefits to help you decide what's best for you.Some common side effects of hormone replacement therapy include breast pain and tenderness, dizziness, and headaches.Bisphosphonates.Bisphosphonates also prevent the loss of calcium from bones and may lessen osteoporosis caused by hyperparathyroidism. Some side effects associated with bisphosphonates include low blood pressure, a fever and vomiting.

The drug may trick the parathyroid glands into releasing less parathyroid hormone. This drug is sold as cinacalcet (Sensipar).Cinacalcet may be an option to treat primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly if surgery hasn't successfully cured the disorder or a person isn't a good surgery candidate.Cinacalcet and vitamin D analogs (prescription forms of vitamin D) are used to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease. These medications help keep the balance of calcium and phosphorus minerals so that the parathyroid glands don't have to work hard.The most commonly reported side effects of cinacalcet are joint and muscle pain, diarrhea, nausea, and respiratory infection.Hormone replacement therapy.For women who have gone through menopause and have signs of osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy may help bones keep calcium. However, this treatment doesn't address the underlying problems with the parathyroid glands.Prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of blood clots and breast cancer. Work with your health care provider to evaluate the risks and benefits to help you decide what's best for you.Some common side effects of hormone replacement therapy include breast pain and tenderness, dizziness, and headaches.Bisphosphonates.Bisphosphonates also prevent the loss of calcium from bones and may lessen osteoporosis caused by hyperparathyroidism.

    "780.4: Dizziness": "Medications\nWater pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes.\nMedications that relieve dizziness and nausea. Your doctor may prescribe drugs to provide immediate relief from vertigo, dizziness and nausea, including prescription antihistamines and anticholinergics. Many of these drugs cause drowsiness.\nAnti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness.\nPreventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent migraine attacks.",
    "372.30: Conjunctivitis": "Treatment for allergic conjunctivitis\nIf the irritation is allergic conjunctivitis, your health care provider may prescribe one of many different types of eye drops for people with allergies.

Radiation therapy is typically used for small to medium-sized eye melanomas.\nLaser treatment\nTreatment that uses a laser to kill the melanoma cells may be an option in certain situations. One type of laser treatment, called thermotherapy, uses an infrared laser and is sometimes used in combination with radiation therapy.",
    "435.9: Transient ischemic attack": "Several medicines may lower the risk of stroke after a TIA. Your healthcare professional recommends a medicine based on what caused the TIA, where it was located, its type and how bad the blockage was. Your healthcare professional may prescribe:\nAnti-platelet drugs. These medicines make a circulating blood cell called platelets less likely to stick together. Sticky platelets begin to form clots when blood vessels are injured. Clotting proteins in blood plasma also are involved in the process.\nAspirin is the most commonly used anti-platelet medicine. Aspirin is also the least expensive treatment with the fewest potential side effects. An alternative to aspirin is the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix).\nAnticoagulants.\nThese medicines require careful monitoring. If you have atrial fibrillation, your healthcare professional may prescribe a direct oral anticoagulant such as apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) or dabigatran (Pradaxa), which may be safer than warfarin due to lower bleeding risk.",

    "801.21: Craniosynostosis": "A team that includes a specialist in surgery of the head and face (craniofacial surgeon) and a specialist in brain surgery (neurosurgeon) generally performs the procedure. Surgery can be done by endoscopic or open surgery. Both types of procedures generally produce very good cosmetic results with low risk of complications.\nEndoscopic surgery. This minimally invasive surgery may be considered for babies up to age 6 months. Surgery done early is preferred. Using a lighted tube and camera (endoscope) inserted through small scalp cuts (incisions), the surgeon removes the affected suture to allow the baby's brain to grow properly. Compared with an open procedure, endoscopic surgery has a smaller incision, typically involves only a one-night hospital stay and usually does not require a blood transfusion.\nOpen surgery. Generally, open surgery is done for babies older than 6 months. The surgeon makes an incision in the scalp and cranial bones, then reshapes the affected portion of the skull. The skull position is held in place with plates and screws that are absorbable. Open surgery typically involves a hospital stay of three or four days, and a blood transfusion is usually necessary. It's generally a one-time procedure, but in complex cases, multiple open surgeries are often required to correct the baby's head shape.",
    "345.10: Epilepsy": "these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy:\nVagus nerve stimulation. Vagus nerve stimulation may be an option when medicines haven't worked well enough to control seizures and surgery isn't possible. A device called a vagus nerve stimulator is implanted underneath the skin of the chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in the neck.\nDeep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of the brain, typically the thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in the chest. The generator regularly sends electrical pulses to the brain at timed intervals and may reduce seizures. Deep brain stimulation is often used for people whose seizures don't get better with medicine.\nResponsive neurostimulation. These implantable, pacemaker-like devices can help reduce how often seizures occur. The devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures as they start. They deliver electrical stimulation to stop the seizure. Research shows that this therapy has few side effects and can provide long-term seizure relief.",
    "714.2: Lupus": "Treatment for lupus depends on your signs and symptoms. Determining whether you should be treated and what medications to use requires a careful discussion of the benefits and risks with your doctor.As your signs and symptoms flare and subside, you and your doctor may find that you'll need to change medications or dosages. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. StrongerNSAIDsare available by prescription. Side effects ofNSAIDsmay include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems.Antimalarial drugs.Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications.Corticosteroids.Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones, high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy.Immunosuppressants.Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate (Cellcept), methotrexate (Trexall, Xatmep, others), cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf) and leflunomide (Arava). Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer.Biologics.A different type of medication, belimumab (Benlysta) administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people.
