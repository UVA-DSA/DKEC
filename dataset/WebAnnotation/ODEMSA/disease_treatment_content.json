If the seizure persists give MIDAZOLAM 0.2 mg / kg INTRANASAL (max single dose 10 mg) OR- give MIDAZOLAM 0.1 mg / kg IV / IM (max single dose 10 mg)\na. Repeat dose in 5 minutes if seizure persists.\nb. If Midazolam is unavailable, administer, DIAZEPAM 0.25 mg / kg up to 5 mg slow IV push, titrated to effect. Diazepam may also be administered Per Rectum (PR) in pediatric patients.\n \n6. Perform rapid glucose determination. If glucose less than 60 mg / dL or clinical signs and symptoms indicate hypoglycemia, refer to the Hypoglycemia protocol\n   \n7. Establish an IV of normal saline at KVO.\n  \n8. Place patient on cardiac monitor (sometime life-threatening dysrhythmias can cause seizure-like activity).\n \n9. Consider placing the patient in the recovery position during the postictal period.\n    \n10. Transport and perform ongoing assessment as indicated.",
    "Medical - Altered Mental Status (Protocol 9 - 14)": "1. Perform general patient management.      \n2. Maintain patient in a supine position and assess \nfor C -spine precautions.      \n3. Administer oxygen to maintain SPO2 94 - 99%     \n4. Assess blood glucose level.  Refer to Pediatric Hypoglycemia Protocol.     \n5. If child is over 20kg and respiratory effort remains \ndiminished and opiate administration is \nsuspected, give NARCAN INTRANASAL 2mg \n(one vial). May repeat one time.      \n6. Establish IV of Normal Saline. Keep at KVO rate \nunless hypotensive. If hypotensive, refer to \nPediatric Shock protocol.      \n7. Transport and reassess as needed.",
    "Injury - Burns - Thermal (Protocol 10 - 2)": "1. Stop the burning process:**\n\na. Thermal burns: Lavage the burned area with sterile water or saline to cool skin. Do not attempt to wipe off semisolids (grease, tar, wax, etc.) Do not apply ice. Dry the body when the burn area is greater than or equal to 10% TBSA to prevent hypothermia.\n\nb. Dry chemical burns: Brush off dry powder, then lavage with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to the hospital.\n\nc. Liquid chemical burns: Lavage the burned area with copious amounts of tepid water (sterile, if possible) for 20 minutes. Continue en route to the hospital.\n\n**2. Support life-threatening problems.**\n\n**3. Perform general patient management.**\n\n**Protocol 10-2 Continued BURNS**\n\n**EMR EMT A I P**\n\n**4. Administer oxygen, via non-rebreather mask, at 10 - 15 L / min. as necessary.** Use humidified oxygen if suspected inhalation injury and when available.\n\n**5. If the patient is in critical respiratory distress, consider early placement of an advanced airway.**\n\n*Endotracheal Intubation / cricothyrotomy are reserved as Paramedic only.*\n\n**6. Remove clothing from around burned area, but do not remove/peel off skin or tissue.** Remove and secure all jewelry and tight fitting clothing.\n\n**7. Assess the extent of the burn using the rule of nines and the degree of burn severity.**\n\n**8. Cover the burned area with a clean, dry dressing.** Wet dressing may be used if the burned TBSA is less than 10%.\n\n**9. If a partial or full thickness burn involves more than 20% TBSA, establish an IV of NS or LR (if available).** Infuse the fluid amounts listed as below. If the patient develops signs and symptoms of fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, crackles, rhonchi, decreasing SpO2), slow the IV to KVO.\n\na. For patients 5 years and younger, start at 125mL/hr.\nb. For patients 6 -13 years, start at 250mL/hr.\nc. For patients 14 years and older, start rate at 500 mL/hr.\n\n**10. For pain control, refer to the Pediatric Pain Management protocol.**\n\n**11. Perform ongoing assessment as indicated and transport major burns to Level 1 Burn Center.** Transport minor burns to appropriate facility.",
    "Injury - Head (Protocol 10 - 4)": "1. Perform general patient management and baseline GCS.\n2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation. Obtain mechanism or injury.\n3. Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 94 - 99%. Consider supporting respirations with a BVM. If signs of hypoventilation are present, ventilate with BVM at an age appropriate rate.\n4. Monitor capnography if BVM or intubated/alternative airway. Attempt to maintain between 35 - 45 mm Hg.\n5.
